# Path-Finding-Algorithms
This is a project I made implementing different search methods on a grid. The searches are animated as they happen, and the tiles in the final path are displayed after teh search concludes.

Searches include: 
- Breadthe-First Search
- Depth-First Search
- Depth Limited Search
- Iterative Deepening Search
- Greedy Best-First Search
- A*

Includes weighted tiles for A*
